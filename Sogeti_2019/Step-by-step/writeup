In this challenge, we had to find a password hidden in a wav file (Step1.wav).
The most classic technique used to hide data in a wav file is to hide it in its
least significant bytes.

By using a stegano tool found on github, we can find an image (Step2.bmp) in
the wav file.

//TODO find wav and display exact command used
